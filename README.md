Ifiok Jr. Emacs Configuration
=============

This is my personal emacs configuration for easier javascript, coffeescript, python and golang programming.

Pretty much all the credit goes to great startup templates like [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) and [emacs.js](https.github.com/azer/emacs.js).

This is just me tweaking with the configuration until things felt more attuned to my development tastes.
